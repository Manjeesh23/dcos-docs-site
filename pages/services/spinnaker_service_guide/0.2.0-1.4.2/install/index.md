excerpt: Installing DC/OS Apache Spinnaker from the web interface or the CLI
featureMaturity:
enterprise: false
---

 DC/OS Apache Spinnaker service is available in the Universe and can be installed using either the web interface or the DC/OS CLI.

The default DC/OS Apache Spinnaker Service installation provides reasonable defaults for trying out the service, but that may not be sufficient for production use. You may require different configurations depending on the context of the deployment.

## Prerequisites

- If you are using Enterprise DC/OS, you may [need to provision a service account](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/security/ent/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) before installing DC/OS Spinnaker Service. Only someone with `superuser` permission can create the service account.
  - `strict` [security mode](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/security/ent/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) requires a service account.

 - In `permissive` security mode a service account is optional.
 - The `disabled` security mode does not require a service account.
 - Your cluster must have at least three private nodes.

- **Tip:** A complete guide to Configuring DC/OS Access for Spinnaker can be found [here](../security/serviceaccountdetail.md).

# Installing from the DC/OS CLI

To start a basic test cluster of DC/OS Apache Spinnaker Service, run the following command on the DC/OS CLI. Enterprise DC/OS users must follow additional instructions.

   ```shell
   dcos package install spinnaker
   ```

This command creates a new instance with the default name `spinnaker`. Two instances cannot share the same name, so if you install additional instances beyond the default instance you must customize the name at install time for each additional instance. However, the application can be installed using the same name in case of foldered installation, wherein we can install the same application in different folders.

All DC/OS Apache Spinnaker Service CLI commands have a `--name`  argument, allowing you to specify which instance to query. If you do not specify a service name, the CLI assumes a default value matching the package name, such as `spinnaker`. The default value for `--name` can be customized via the DC/OS CLI configuration:

   ```shell
   dcos spinnaker --name=spinnaker <cmd>
   ```

You can specify a custom configuration in an `options.json` file and pass it to `dcos package install` using the `--options` parameter.

   ```shell
   dcos package install spinnaker --options=options.json
   ```

For more information on building the `options.json` file, see [DC/OS documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/usage/managing-services/config-universe-service/) for service configuration access.

## Installing from the DC/OS web interface

Note:  Alternatively, you can install DC/OS Spinnaker Service from the DC/OS web interface. Select the app from the Catalog and choose Deploy.

If you install Apache Spinnaker from the DC/OS web interface, the `dcos spinnaker` CLI commands are not automatically installed to your workstation. They may be manually installed using the DC/OS CLI:

   ```shell
   dcos package install spinnaker --cli
   ```
   ## Installing multiple instances

By default, the spinnaker is installed with a service name of spinnaker. You may specify a different name using a custom service configuration as follows:

   ```shell
   {
       "service": {
           "name": "spinnaker-other"
       }
   }
   ```

When the above JSON configuration is passed to the package install spinnaker  command via the --options argument, the new service will use the name specified in that JSON configuration:

   ```shell
   dcos package install spinnaker --options=spinnaker-other.json
   ```
   
Multiple instances of Spinnaker may be installed into your DC/OS cluster by customizing the name of each instance. For example, you might have one instance of Spinnaker named spinnaker-staging and another named spinnaker-prod, each with its own custom  configuration.

After specifying a custom name for your instance, it can be reached using dcos spinnaker CLI commands or directly over HTTP as described below.

Note: The service name cannot be changed after initial install. Changing the service name would require installing a new instance of the service against the new name, then copying over any data as necessary to the new instance.

## Installing into folders

In DC/OS 1.10 and above, services may be installed into folders by specifying a slash-delimited service name. For example:

   ```shell
   {
       "service": {
           "name": "/foldered/path/to/spinnaker"
       }
   }
   ```
The above example will install the service under a path of foldered => path => to => spinnaker. It can then be reached using dcos spinnaker  CLI commands or directly over HTTP as described below.

Note:  The service folder location cannot be changed after initial install.Changing the service location would require installing a new instance of the service against the new location, then copying over any data as necessary to the new instance.

## Service Discovery
Each Service Discovery requires parameters to be passed for thier respective SD, Promethesu DC\OS mesos offers follwoing service discovery mechanism :

1. Consul_sd_config :
Consul SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from Consul's Catalog API.

Parameters required for consul sd :
           
            consul  : 
            server  : <host> | default = "localhost:8500"
            service : A list of services for which targets are retrieved. If omitted, all services are scraped.
 
2. Dns_sd_condig : 

A DNS-based service discovery configuration allows specifying a set of DNS domain names which are periodically queried to discover a list of targets.
This service discovery method only supports basic DNS A, AAAA and SRV record queries, but not the advanced DNS-SD approach specified in RFC6763.

Parameters required for dns sd :

           dnsjobname       : Job name 
           Domain name      : DNS domain names to be queried
           Query Type       : The type of DNS query to perform,default = 'SRV' 
           Dns port         : The port number used if the query type is not SRV
           Refresh interval : <duration> The time after which the provided names are refreshed

3. EC2 SD :
EC2 SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from AWS EC2 instances. 


        Region name  : The AWS Region <string>
        Access key   : The AWS API keys. If blank, the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are used.
        Secret key   : <secret>
        Ec2 port     :  The port to scrape metrics from
   
4. Marathon Sd Config :
 Marathon SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets using the Marathon REST API. Spinnaker will periodically check the REST endpoint for currently running tasks and create a target group for every app that has at least one healthy task.

        Marathon job name : JOb Name
        Polling interval  : refresh_interval <duration>
        Servername        : List of URLs to be used to contact Marathon servers.You need to provide at least one server URL.

## Addressing named instances

After youâ€™ve installed the service under a custom name or under a folder, it may be accessed from all dcos spinnaker CLI commands using the --name argument. By default, the --name value defaults to the name of the package, or spinnaker.

For example, if you had an instance named spinnaker-dev, the following command would invoke a pod list command against it:

   ```shell
   dcos spinnaker --name=spinnaker-dev pod list
   ```
The same query would be over HTTP as follows:

   ```shell
   curl -H "Authorization:token=$auth_token" <dcos_url>/service/spinnaker-dev/v1/pod
   ```
Likewise, if you had an instance in a folder like /foldered/path/to/spinnaker, the following command would invoke a pod list command against it:

   ```shell
   dcos spinnaker --name=/foldered/path/to/spinnaker pod list
   ```
   
Similarly, it could be queried directly over HTTP as follows:

   ```shell
   curl -H "Authorization:token=$auth_token" <dcos_url>/service/foldered/path/to/spinnaker-dev/v1/pod
   ```
Note: You may add a -v (verbose) argument to any dcos spinnaker command to see the underlying HTTP queries that are being made. This can be a useful tool to see where the CLI is getting its information. In practice, dcos spinnaker commands are a thin wrapper around an HTTP interface provided by the DC/OS Spinnaker Service itself.

## Virtual Networks

DC/OS Spinnaker supports deployment on virtual networks on DC/OS, allowing each container (task) to have its own IP address and not use port resources on the agent machines. This can be specified by passing the following configuration during installation:

   ```shell
   {
       "service": {
           "virtual_network_enabled": true
       }
   }
   ```
Note: Once the service is deployed on a virtual network, it cannot be updated to use the host network.


## Minimal Installation

For development purposes, you may wish to install Spinnaker on a local DC/OS cluster. For this, you can use dcos-docker or dcos-vagrant.
To start a minimal cluster with a single broker, create a JSON options file named sample-spinnaker-minimal.json:

   ```shell
   {
       "node": {
       "count": 1,
       "mem": 512,
       "cpu": 0.5
       }
   }
   ```
The command below creates a cluster using sample-spinnaker-minimal.json:


   ```shell
   dcos package install spinnaker --options=sample-spinnaker-minimal.json
   ```
## Integration with DC/OS access controls

In Enterprise DC/OS 1.10 and above, you can integrate your SDK-based service with DC/OS ACLs to grant users and groups access to only certain services. You do this by installing your service into a folder, and then restricting access to some number of folders. Folders also allow you to namespace services. For instance, staging/spinnaker and production/spinnaker.

Steps:

  1. In the DC/OS GUI, create a group, then add a user to the group. Or, just create a user. Click Organization > Groups > + or Organization > Users > +. If you create a group, you must also create a user and add them to the group.

  2. Give the user permissions for the folder where you will install your service. In this example, we are creating a user called developer, who will have access to the /testing folder.

  3. Select the group or user you created. Select ADD PERMISSION and then toggle to INSERT PERMISSION STRING. Add each of the following permissions to your user or group, and then click ADD PERMISSIONS.

   ```shell
   dcos:adminrouter:service:marathon full
   dcos:service:marathon:marathon:services:/testing full
   dcos:adminrouter:ops:mesos full
   dcos:adminrouter:ops:slave full
   ```
  4. Install your service into a folder called test. Go to Catalog, then search for spinnaker.

  5. Click CONFIGURE and change the service name to /testing/spinnaker, then deploy.
     The slashes in your service name are interpreted as folders. You are deploying spinnaker in the /testing folder. Any user with access to the /testing folder will have access to the service.

Important:

  a. Services cannot be renamed. Because the location of the service is specified in the name, you cannot move services between folders.
  b. DC/OS 1.9 and earlier does not accept slashes in service names. You may be able to create the service, but you will encounter unexpected problems.

## Interacting with your foldered service

1. Interact with your foldered service via the DC/OS CLI with this flag: --name=/path/to/myservice.
2. To interact with your foldered service over the web directly, use http://<dcos-url>/service/path/to/myservice. E.g., http://<dcos-url>/service/testing/spinnaker/v1/endpoints.

## Placement Constraints

Placement constraints allow you to customize where a service is deployed in the DC/OS cluster. Depending on the service, some or all components may be configurable using Marathon operators (reference). For example, [["hostname", "UNIQUE"]] ensures that at most one pod instance is deployed per agent.

A common task is to specify a list of whitelisted systems to deploy to. To achieve this, use the following syntax for the placement constraint:
   ```shell
   [["hostname", "LIKE", "10.0.0.159|10.0.1.202|10.0.3.3"]]
  ```
You must include spare capacity in this list, so that if one of the whitelisted systems goes down, there is still enough room to repair your service (via pod replace) without requiring that system.

**Example**

In order to define placement constraints as part of an install or update of a service they should be provided as a JSON encoded string. For example one can define a placement constraint in an options file as follows:

   ```shell
   cat options.json
   {
       "hello": {
       "placement": "[[\"hostname\", \"UNIQUE\"]]"
       }
   }
   ```
This file can be referenced to install a spinnaker service.

   ```shell
   dcos package install hello-world --options=options.json
   ```
Likewise this file can be referenced to update a spinnaker service.

   ```shell
   dcos spinnaker update start --options=options.json
   ```
## Secured Installation
For secure installation its recommended to do folder installation and folder access should be limited.
